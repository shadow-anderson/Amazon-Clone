<h2>Amazon Clone</h2>

This is a clone for amazon.com website. I tried it, made it, had quite difficulties as a beginner but at the end, i learned.
Learning was the best part for me and this little project has served as a significant real learning experience for me.

This is not a responsive website but just a outlook made using html and css only.

I hope you will like it! ;)

I have attached the images and logos that i have used in this project. Also, i did take some help from Apna College!
Shraddha Khapra has provided these images and logos.
